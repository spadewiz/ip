## Command Format Conventions

- Words in `<angle brackets>` are parameters to be supplied by the user (e.g. `todo <description>`).
- Items in `[square brackets]` are optional (e.g. `[/note <note>]`).
- Date and time inputs must strictly follow the `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` format (e.g., `2026-10-15 1800` for 15 Oct 2026, 6:00 PM).
- Index parameters (`<index>`) refer to the 1-based index numbers shown in the `list` or `clients` view.

## Data Storage & Auto-Save

Wiz automatically saves your tasks and client records to local storage after every modifying command:

Data files are automatically created if they do not already exist, and are reloaded the next time Wiz starts.
